## Minecraft LSP implementation  
This is an implementation of the [language server protocol](https://langserver.org/) for Minecraft Functions.   
Additionally, the default configuration comes with a Visual Studio Code extension which manages this.

Parsers are implemented based on <https://libraries.minecraft.net/com/mojang/brigadier/0.1.11/brigadier-0.1.11-sources.jar>
